Hi! My name is Rithika. I'm a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram (aka real life Hogwarts, complete with innumerable staircases and whomping willows). I spend most of my time calculating cross-sections and brewing coffee. 

I can be found on [Twitter](x.com/astrorithika), [GitHub](github.com/rithika-ganesan), and in the corner of PSB3103B.
