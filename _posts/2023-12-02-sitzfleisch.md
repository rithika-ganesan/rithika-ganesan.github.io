> 'The Germans have this lovely word, _Sitzfleisch_,' Professor Playfair said pleasantly when Ramy protested that they had over forty hours of reading a week. 'Translated literally, it means "sitting meat". Which all goes to say, sometimes you simply need to sit on your bottom and getting things done.' **â€”R.F. Kuang, Babel**
